  <h1 class="display-4" >MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY!</h1>
  <p class="lead">
We fell asleep in one world , and awake in another

Suddenly Disney is out of magic,
Paris is no longer romantic ,
New doesn’t stand up anymore,
The chinese wall is no longer a fortress,and Mecca is empty

Hugs and kisses are suddenly the weapons,
And not visiting parents  and friends becomes an act of love

Suddelny  you realize that power ,beauty and money are worthless, and cant get you the oxygen you are fighting for

The world continues  its life and it is beautiful.It  only puts humans in cages.I  think its sending us a message:
“YOU ARE NOT NECESSARY. THE AIR , EARTH, WATER AND SKY  WITHOUT  YOU ARE FINE. WHEN YOU COME BACK ,REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE MY GUESTS.NOT MY MASTERS.”
 </p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>These lines echoes reality .

The SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China. The Chinese authorities first officially reported its presence to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, however, it almost certainly started spreading there much before that, possibly sometime early December 2019. Since then, it has spread to almost every country on earth taking lives, shutting down economies, and creating worldwide havoc and panic of the proportions perhaps not seen since World War II, with no signs yet of slowing down.
Government-imposed lockdowns to check the virus-spread and/or people voluntarily staying at homes have completely pummelled major job providing industries including hospitality, transport (air, sea, rail and road) and pretty much the entire MSME sector.

While the world is fighting a war against the novel Coronavirus, people who are sitting at home under a lockdown are fighting another kind of war within themselves.  This war is that of fear, uncertainty, panic, anxiety, loneliness and even depression for some.
Many people  are feeling clueless, anxious and emotionally drained out thinking how they will manage their lives after the lockdown is over and even now as this is a complete change of lifestyle for many. There is anxiety that is growing with each passing day and people who were going through a low phase; this situation has only aggravated their condition.
BUT YES, THIS SHALL TOO PASS, AND THE DAY WILL COME WHEN ALL THIS GETS OVER .
BUT LETS JUST FACE IT , THAT TIME DOESN’T WAIT FOR ANYTHING . SO LETS ADD LIFE TO DAYS AND NOT DAYS TO LIFE .
A disaster or emergency can hurt people and damage buildings, houses, and neighborhoods. Disasters can be scary and confusing. But we must remember that a disaster is not our fault. We haven’t done anything to make it happen. They can be scary for kids, grown-ups, and pets, too.
      When we hear, read, or watch news about an outbreak of an infectious  Corona , we may feel anxious and show signs of stress—even when the outbreak affects people far from where you live and you are at low or no risk of getting sick. These signs of stress are normal, and may be more likely seen in people with loved ones in parts of the world affected by the outbreak. In the wake of an infectious disease outbreak, we need to monitor physical and mental health of ourselves as well as others. We must always remember that we are never alone, we have so many people for us and similarly we should also be there available for people around us. 
Although we must know that this disease should not overpower us, thereby greatly affecting our mental health. At such time our mental health is equally important as our physical health. As the old saying goes “A healthy mind resides in a healthy body”. Also, to help other people in whatever way we can and also to keep ourselves sound mental health should be prioritized. In such situations we can connect with others who may be just as us experiencing stress about the outbreak and talk to them about our feelings about the outbreak, share reliable health information, and also enjoy conversation unrelated to the outbreak, to remind us of the many important and positive things we still have in our lives.
We must try to relax our body often by doing things that work for us like taking deep breaths, stretching, meditating, or engage in pleasurable hobbies/ activities, like talking with your friends and loved ones, cooking, reading, designing, stitching, singing, dancing, watching web series, movies etc. just whatever makes you feel good and relaxed. Other than this we should also follow some basics like eating healthy foods, being hydrated, frequently washing our hands with soaps or handwash and yes practicing social distancing. Social distancing sometimes might be annoying and irritating but we must know that it’s the need of the hour. For keeping our loved ones, our country and ourselves safe it is necessary. Even the experts have agreed that the COVID-19 outbreak cannot be stopped, but that it can be slowed through the implementation of social distancing measures. Limiting human contact will reduce transmission rates and the more social distancing measures are followed, the slower infection rates will be, preventing an unmanageable peak of cases.We should see this period of quarantine as an opportunity of spending time with our family which we quite often miss owing to our hectic schedules, pursuing our hobbies, doing things which we like and weren’t able to do because of our busy routine life. 
And according to our team one most important thing we all must keep in mind and also acknowledge others is to set limits on how much time we spend reading or watching news about the outbreak. Yes, of course we all will want to stay up to date on news of the outbreak, particularly if we do have loved ones in places where many people have fallen sick. But we must make sure to take time away from the news to focus on things in your life that are going well and that we can control. The best way to deal with it is to remind ourselves that this is a temporary period of isolation and that our efforts are helping others in the community.
Lets thank god that we are lucky enough that we are safe. Many labourers in India don’t have place to stay .
YES, we cant deny the fact that its not only about how to spend the time in lockdown .The thing that everyone is stressed about is  firstly there  lifes , there jobs , there carrers.  The government is taking various steps to help each and every sector of the society . The governemt  has  the plans  for lower , middile ,working , labour class. So stay calm
With the ongoing Lockdown and restrictions India managed to become Atmanirbhar, The Atmanirbhar scheme could give the Country's disrupted business
operations by promoting Make in India manufacturing, encouraging substitution of imports of low-technology goods from other countries, specially China.

</p>
<p>The Government of India also announced a 20-lakh-crore package that focuses tax-breaks for MSME's, Power Sector, for small businesses, as well as incentives for domestic manufacturing.

The kind request from our team to everyone is to please maintain the Lockdown to yourself even after it gets over.
