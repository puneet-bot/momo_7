  Coronavirus Live Updates: PM Modi, Amit Shah Discuss Lockdown Strategy; 7,466 New Cases In India In 24 Hours
  <h3>COVID-19 India LIVE Updates: More than 3.5 lakh have died too across the world, but very few new cases are being reported in China for the last few days.</h3>

The meeting comes a day after Mr Shah reached out to all Chief Ministers for feedback on the lockdown and their views about its extension or lifting after May 31, when the current phase is scheduled to end. All Chief Ministers have given their views on how they want to move forward. Over the last few days, the Prime Minister's Office has been busy reviewing the entire lockdown period to decide on the way forward from June 1.
The number of coronavirus cases in India reached 1.65 lakh on Friday, as India reported 7,466 new cases in 24 hours, its biggest jump so far. India has recorded 4,706 COVID-19 deaths sor far, making it the ninth worst affected country in the world, even surapssing China where the virus originated.

Maharashtra remains the worst-affected state in the country with nearly 60,000 cases and 1,982 deaths so far. State capital Mumbai, regarded as the financial capital of India, is the worst-affected metro with over 35,000 confirmed cases. Tamil Nadu, the second most-affected state, reported 827 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, a second consecutive day of record spike in numbers. Overall, the state has 19,372 COVID-19 cases and has reported 145 deaths.

    Goa Minister Michael Lobo on Friday urged state Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to ban the entry of people coming from Maharashtra and said that it is the only solution because there is a transmission of COVID-19 in Maharashtra in a big way.

"Goa was totally in the green zone and we are still in the green zone as far as the state is concerned. I think one, two or three people from Delhi who came in had the virus. Maximum people are from Maharashtra, who came in and were COVID-19 positive. The other day also we had taken a meeting with all the Cabinet ministers and we have made it compulsory that all the people who are coming in the state must be tested for COVID-19," Mr Lobo told ANI.

"Now my demand to the Chief Minister of Goa will be that you ban the entry of people from Maharashtra. I am not against the people of Maharashtra. Ban the entry for a certain period. Entry to the people from Maharashtra should be banned. This should be banned by road, by rail, by air. Now if you want to stop having more COVID patients coming into Goa, we have to ban that entry. This is the only solution because there is a transmission of coronavirus in Maharashtra in a big way," he added.</p>

      <hr class="my-4">
<p>In a bizarre incident in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut, a monkey snatched blood samples of Covid-19 patients from a lab technician of the Meerut Medical College on Friday.

The video doing rounds on social media shows, the monkey perched atop a tree and chewing on a white packet on what appears to be a sample.

“The incident was brought to our notice and we enquired the lab technician. As per our information, the samples that had been snatched are not the testing samples which consist of the throat and tongue swab. These were blood samples that are taken from Covid-19 patients during routine treatment. The Covid-19 samples are kept in a box while these samples are not,” said SK Garg, Principal, Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College, Meerut.

According to officials, the blood samples are routinely tested.

The medical authorities stated that there is no need to panic about possible spread of the virus through the monkeys. “There is no evidence so far that it spreads through animals and there is no need to worry,” said Garg.</p>

</button>
    Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Friday suggested that the lockdown should continue beyond May 31 and justified the strictness at the Delhi borders, saying free movement will lead to a surge in coronavirus cases in the state.

"If you ask my personal opinion, strictness will have to be maintained. Giving more relaxations at this stage can lead to increase in cases. Because the stage at which coronavirus is right now, need of the hour is that lockdown should be extended," he told reporters here.

"Already relaxations have been given like opening of 'bazaar'' (markets), factories... domestic flights have restarted. I am not in favour of more relaxations because cases are going up," Mr Vij said, adding he would convey his opinion to the chief minister.

Citing a sharp increase in coronavirus cases in the Haryana districts adjoining Delhi during the past week, Mr Vij had on Thursday issued orders for sealing borders with the national capital.

"Cases are increasing in the districts adjoining Delhi. The main reason for this is movement of people from Delhi into these adjoining districts of Haryana. Barring the categories exempted by the Delhi High Court and those exempted by the Centre under lockdown4, the state borders for others will remain completely sealed," the order had said.
